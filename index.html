  The main goal of our experiment is to show a real-time detailed 3-D face tracking system. The face tracking system consists of two big steps to consider. First, we have to make a deformable 3-D face scan. The quality of the face depends on what purpose the user wants to use it. Second, we have to track the face and deform the 3-D face scan from 1th step. The 3-D face, shown on the screen has to track the userâ€™s face and deform in a few milliseconds to provide a real- time experience.
